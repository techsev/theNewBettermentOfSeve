##AND WE'RE BACK...##
#07.09.15#

Well, it's been over a year since the last time I updated the site. The last 12-18 months have been an absolute blur; some great events like having my second child and getting married, and some devastating moment with the passing of both my father and grand mother.

These events have affected me so drastically, changed my point of view on life and career. So much so that I felt it was time to get back into personal self improvement. I want to be a better web developer, but more so then that, I want to be a better member of the amazing web development community.

So basically I took my old betterment site, kept what I liked, drop the static site generator and re-built it.

Now I'm using Wordpress as my CMS back end (Since it's what I use 99% of the time and I love it) and  Angular JS for my Front End (Because it was a good excuse to learn it.)

There's not much else going on right now on the site, but like before, that's going to change. I'm going to be pushing myself to dabble in lots of different web related technologies and (hopefully?) accomplish a few projects that I've had rolling around in my head.

So that's it for now, stay tuned, this site still has a lot of growing to do, but for now it's something.

This site / project is far from finished, I just wanted to have something to show. 
Are there problems with my code. Absolutely. Feel free to point them out, and I will make every attempts to change them.

This is a living project, and I plan to come back to it everyday, but for now, I was happy with what I have made so far.
